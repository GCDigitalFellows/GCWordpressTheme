FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WordPress Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the brilliant Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v2.1.1 of Twitter’s Bootstrap.

Here’s what we’ve got so far. Star this project on Github to keep up with its progress.

Responsive
__________

We stick as closely as possible to bootstrap so this thing is natually responsive. 

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site)
    - Standard page with left sidebar (this page)
    - Page with right sidebar
    - Full width page

Theme Options Panel

Want to change some colors? Want the top nav to scroll with the content? Hide the search box in the top nav? Do it in the options panel.

Shortcodes

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Twitter Bootstrap.
