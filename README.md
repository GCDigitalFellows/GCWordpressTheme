FEATURES
========

Here are some of the things that are working so far:

Responsive
__________

By relying on the Bootstrap 3.0 framework, this theme should be fully responsive. It is built around a mobile-first logic with breakpoints that can be changed via LESS.

Page Templates
______________

There are 3 built-in templates, but this belies the flexibility of sidebars that can be assigned on a per-page basis.

* Homepage template, with optional jumbotron area, carousel slider, and widget sidebar
* Standard page, with one optional sidebar on the left or right
* Jumbotron page, with a full-width jumbotron area in place of the page title and optional sidebars

Theme Options
___________________

Lots of options for changing colors, typography, and page elements

Shortcodes
__________

A number of shortcodes are included so you can easily add UI elements found in Twitter Bootstrap.

* Galleries: replace the default gallery shortcode with a lightbox-enabled, popover equipped, Bootstrap-esque gallery

Sidebars
________

There are three included widget areas that can be assigned to individual pages or archive/blog pages.
