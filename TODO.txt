When migrating to Bootstrap 3.0
-------------------------------
* Check all col- and add col class
* Push/Pull main column and sidebar so that the sidebars are always declared after the main column (important for mobile)
* Use less mixins to create the class layout declarations (e.g. #content -> col-lg-8, #content-full -> col-lg-12, etc.)
* Ensure that infinite scroll doesn't break

* check icons: look into converting all class .icon-* to .glyphicon .glyphicon-*
* modify search form to be pretty/helpful
