Add author+avatar to postmeta, but probably only on singular pages
give special formatting to comments using ".bypostauthor" class
look into enabling html tags/formatting for comments
support for jetpack tiled galleries...?
clean up the wp_link_pages calls on all of the pages
* make sure it's included where appropriate
* restyle so that it looks like the pager produced by the page_navi function
single.php: Show navigation links to next and previous post using previous_post_link() and next_post_link().
move comment formatting to custom-styles.less
* use less to configure background colors
* use variables to control font colors
